## Projects

- [Project 1](https://liv-edi.github.io/Project1/): For this project we used the command line interface to create a number of folders that were listed in a tree like structure. We practiced using the ping command and the break keyboard sequence. We created and executed the JS files using Node.js and VSCode terminal run and debug.

- [Project 2](https://liv-edi.github.io/Project2/): In this project we used the CLI to create and use a git repository. We refactored our JS code from the Project 1 to practice using git and refactoring.

- [Project 3](https://liv-edi.github.io/Project3/): In this project we cerated a coinage code module that could calculate the total value of a coin object. We then updated the server code file to be a Node.js web server using Fastify. The final server displayed a web page with web links to test the coinage code.

- [Project 4](https://liv-edi.github.io/Project4/): In this project we cerated a REST API that works with a data source of questions and answers. We created the code to work with the data source using a code module, and tested the code module using text code that was provided. We also created a Node.js Rest API to handle the GET verb.

- [Project 5](https://liv-edi.github.io/Project5/): In this project we created a Monster game using classes that gave the monsters an initial life value and min. life value for the monster to be alive. When the game ran the monster's life is drained by a random amount and went on until all of the monsters had died.

- [Project 6](https://liv-edi.github.io/Project6/): In this project we created three classes including a Shape class, Rectangle class, and Trinagle class. The Shape class was the bas class for the the Trinagle and Rectangle class which both inherited from the Shape class. The Shape class returned a perimeter value that the other two classes used to return an area value.

- [Project 7](https://liv-edi.github.io/Project7/): In this project we created a CIT Minor Portfolio using GitHub Pages. This portfolio included repositories, GitHub pages that provided a breif decription of the lab or project and a creen capture for each of the labs and projects for the class.
